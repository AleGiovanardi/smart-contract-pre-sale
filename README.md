# BlockFood Token Sale Smart Contract

## Goal

The goal of this smart contract is to handle applications for the BlockFoodToken pre-sale.

The token sale behaviour is coded into the smart contract itself. Nothing is hidden.

## Usage

The BlockFood Token Sale Smart Contract will be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain before the date of the pre-sale.

Its address will be communicated from the [https://blockfood.io](https://bockfood.io) website.

## Dev

The smart contract has been written in test-driven development using the Truffle framework.

### Prerequisite

- Node.js 8+

- Truffle 4.0.1+

```bash
npm i -g truffle
```

### Launch tests

In a console, from the base directory of the project, type:

```bash
truffle test
```

This will output something like this:

```bash
$ truffle test
